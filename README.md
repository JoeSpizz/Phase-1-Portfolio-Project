'What are we going to do Tonight?' 
A single page web application designed to help make it easy for you to plan your evening. With as few, general, decisions as possible.

Inspiration: Indecision is a crippling issue for many of my friends and myself. As soon as I saw the 
'bored API' the app pretty much sprung into my head as a whole. The concept of a event planner that
doesn't require you to ACTUALLY plan sounded perfect.

The design of the app uses HTML, Javascript and CSS to tie everything together.

Primary Features:
Using the Bored API you can define an activity based around a general topic: Recreation, education, etc.
For a few of these activities "number of participants" is also relevant and thus added as a limiter.

Using the Cocktail.db API we can get drink options based on your ingredient.
Using the same API with a difference fetch we then get the ingredients of your chosen beverage.

Using spotify embed codes we can select the playlist we like and play it directly from the site. 

How To Use:
Simply navigate through each option and select what feels best from the drop-down menus. If you like
the option selected there is a dedicated button to add that portion of the evening to your plan. When you've made your three selections the 'itinerary' for the night will be at the bottom of the page.
