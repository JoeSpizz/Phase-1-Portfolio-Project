This will be the package that is my Phase-1 portfolio project. 
Tentatively titling the project "What to do tonight?"

For posterity and to avoid losing this data if I switch to my PC, what 
follows is my initial notes/outilne for the app:


Joe’s Web App: 
A Web App for what to do tonight/with your life

Styled Header “What am I doing tonight?”

Toggle Modes: Light / Dark/ Colorbomb?/ Big font mode?
Insert toggle option on the top left of the screen

As you make selections each selection has button “add to plan”
Which will render that selection on the right/bottom of screen in list of all selections
